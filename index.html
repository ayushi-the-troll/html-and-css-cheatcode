        <h1>THE HTML and CSS cheatcode</h1>

        <p>this is the header element</p>
        <p>it typically contains *surprise* headers</p>
        <p>there are 6 levels of headers</p>
        <h1>this is h1</h1>
        <h2>this is h2</h2>
        <h3>this is h3</h3>

        <p>...and so it goes</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>this is the start of the main element. no visual difference, right?</p>
        <p>that's because we haven't choosen to define borders and paddings and such (yet)</p>
        <p>but if we want to define a separate section...</p>

        <div id="first-div">
            <p>this is the start of the div element</p>
            <p>using CSS we have separated this a bit from the above text</p>
        </div>

        <section id="first-section">
            <p>we can also start a new section element</p>
            <p>virtually, there's no difference between this and a div element, but using this element is more semantically appropriate.</p>
        </section>

        <p>we can also include images in our web page:</p>
        <img id='cat-img' src="https://images.rawpixel.com/image_800/cHJpdmF0ZS9sci9pbWFnZXMvd2Vic2l0ZS8yMDIyLTA1L2pvYjcyNy0yNDAteC5qcGc.jpg"/>

        <p>gifs can be added too:</p>
        <img id="cat-gif" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/9e/1a/e29e1a7bcce0269e79cc7430d7736ee0.gif"/>

        <p>and so can videos!</p>
        <video controls width="300" poster="poster.jpg">
            <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm" />
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

        <p>you can do audios as well but i can't seem to find a safe download of the nyan cat sound so sorry about that lol</p>

        <section class="CSS">
            <div class="css-heading">
                <h1>Now this is the CSS Section</h1>
                <p>isn't this so much prettier? let's start from the basics</p>
            </div>

            <div class="">
                <p>CSS elements can be styled in HTML</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic;">This is italic</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">This is bold</p>

                <p>but they can (and should) also be styled in a separate STYLESHEET</p>
                <p>remember the div element and section element from before? those were styled in the stylesheet for this website called styles.css</p>
                <p>so was the heading for the CSS section</p>
            </div>
        </section>

    </main>
</body>
